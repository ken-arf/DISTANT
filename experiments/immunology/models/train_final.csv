182,pp65-derived peptides,22,24,128,149,The frequencies of CD8(+) T cells directed against IE-1 were similar to those directed against pp65 in donors tested with known pp65-derived peptides.,10482568_6,-1,-1,-1,3,182,-1
195,neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibodies,8,11,50,83,We have recently shown that the administration of neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibodies to Tsk/+ mice prevented the development of skin fibrosis in these mice.,10486156_2,-1,-1,-1,3,195,-1
